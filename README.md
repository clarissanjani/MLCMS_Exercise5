M. Sc. Praktikum - Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling & Simulation (IN2106, IN4267)
==============================
# Exercise 5
We are group B consisting of Eugenia Clarissa Anjani, Maximilian Reiner, and Patrick Bettermann. The exercise is made up of five tasks focused on dynamical systems and bifurcation theory. 

## Project Details
**Description**: We extract functions and vector fields from data by approximating linear and nonlinear functions, and approximate the functions over vector fields. In addition, we perform time-delay embedding where we model periodic signals into a state space so that points can advance in time.

## Environment
The project was developed with Python 3.9. We used Pycharm as our IDE as well as used JupyterLab to run our notebooks. It is possible to run the notebooks also on Jupyter Notebook.

## How to test the software

To run the file, run the following in the folder directory if using Jupyter Notebook in the terminal. 

```
jupyter notebook
```

To run the file, run the following in the folder directory if using JupyterLab in the terminal. 

```
jupyter-lab
```

Each task has its own separate folder structure with the relevant JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook and python scripts.
